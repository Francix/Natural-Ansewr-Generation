## Heterogeneous Memory Network for Generative Question Answering 

The implementation of paper: 
Yao Fu and Yansong Feng, _Natural Answer Generation from Heterogeneous Memory_, NAACL 2018 

The Cumulative Attention Mechanism is implemented in model.py

The [Neural Checklist](https://github.com/uwnlp/neural-checklist) model was originally implemented in Lua Torch, here we reimplemented in tensorflow. 

(Sorry that the model is a bit of messy, this was my first experience in DL4NLP)
